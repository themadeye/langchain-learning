The police have initiated an investigation into the circulation of death threats aimed at the Prime Minister, Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim, on various social media platforms. The incident gained attention following a screenshot from a TikTok video, where a user purportedly offered RM5 million to anyone willing to assassinate the Prime Minister, government ministers, and members of a political party. However, the video has since been removed from the platform. In response, Muhammad Kamil Abdul Munim, Deputy Chief of the Youth Wing of the Justice Party (AMK), revealed that the AMK representative in Putrajaya lodged a formal report about the alarming video at the Putrajaya District Police Headquarters two days ago. "The threatening video posted on TikTok by the account @Jaiadani89 made explicit threats against the Prime Minister, offering a reward of RM5 million to anyone capable of harming him,"  Muhammad Kamil stated during a media briefing held outside the PKR 2023 Annual National Congress at the Putrajaya International Convention Centre (PICC).
